# Virtual
=======
## Note for updated versione >0.3.0
This is a new version of virtual module, that use Proxy for check if the virtual method is replaced.
The problem with the previous version is that you only have an error if you try to use a virtual method that isn't defined in extended class.
Currently I develop under Nodejs, and I hope that the author or others will partecipate for javascript functionality.
